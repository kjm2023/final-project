          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>Hello World! Thanks for visiting my website.</p>
          <p>I am what you might call a free-spirited nerd with a love for teaching
            and learning. One of my first roles out of college was working on the IT
            Help Desk. That quickly transformed into a technology training role. I have
            been teaching technology ever since - professionally and on a volunteer basis.</p>
          <p>My experience includes working in the corporate, non-profit and higher education
            sectors. By far my favorite is higher education. My college teaching experience
            began in 2009 and I have been living my dream since then. What began as a
            part-time passion evolved into a full-time position and I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
          <p>While teaching technology is my first love, you may also find me teaching topics
            such as student development and visual arts.</p>
          <p>In addition to teaching, you can also find me serving on numerous college committees,
            advising prospective and current students and connecting with community members to
            spread the word about our new program.</p>

          <h3>LifeLong Learner</h3>
          <p>Udemy, bootcamps, Coursera - you name it - I'm there. I love to learn.
          It is my personal belief that the makings of a good instructor is a good student.
          When it comes to technology, it is a must that I stay abreast of changes so
          so that I can share the latest and greatest with my students. I will forever be a student.</p>
