          <p>Hello World! Thanks for visiting my website.</p>
          <p>I am what you might call a free-spirited nerd with a love for teaching
            and learning. One of my first roles out of college was working on the IT
            Help Desk. That quickly transformed into a technology training role. I have
            been teaching technology ever since - professionally and on a volunteer basis.</p>
          <p>My experience includes working in the corporate, non-profit and higher Education
            sectors. By far my favorite is higher education. Teaching at the college level
            began in 2009 and I have been living my dream since then.</p>
          <p>My course topics include information technology, student development and
            visual arts.</p>
